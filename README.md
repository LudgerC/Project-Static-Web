# 🎬 PoorFlix

**PoorFlix** is a fictional movie website built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It was created as part of my programming studies to demonstrate front-end structure, layout, and clean design — all without using copyrighted content.

The project includes both:
- a **public website** with a movie catalog, details, and reviews;  
- an **admin panel** for managing movies (add, edit, delete).  

Everything was built from scratch — no frameworks, just pure front-end code.
